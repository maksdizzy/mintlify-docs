# What is Guru Network Framework?

The Guru Network Framework is a **Web3 automation platform** that bridges traditional web services with blockchain technology. It provides a toolkit for building, deploying, and managing automated workflows that integrate on-chain and off-chain operations using BPMN 2.0 standards.


## Core Philosophy

Our framework is built on the principle that **Web3 automation should be accessible, reliable, and secure**. We combine the power of blockchain technology with proven workflow patterns to create a platform that developers can use to build automated DeFi and Web3 applications.
