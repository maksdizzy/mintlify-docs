# Use Cases

The Guru Network Framework enables a wide range of Web3 automation scenarios, from simple trading bots to complex enterprise integrations. Here are some practical examples of how organizations and developers are using the platform.

## ü§ñ Automated Trading Strategies

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Bot
<Card title="Steady Investment Growth" icon="chart-line">
Automatically purchase crypto assets at regular intervals, regardless of price fluctuations, to reduce the impact of volatility over time.
</Card>

**Implementation Example:**
```python
# DCA Strategy Configuration
dca_strategy = {
    "name": "Bitcoin DCA",
    "asset": "BTC",
    "purchase_amount": 100,  # $100 USD
    "frequency": "weekly",   # Every Monday
    "exchanges": ["binance", "coinbase"],
    "slippage_tolerance": 0.5,
    "max_gas_price": 50
}

# Automated execution with risk management
workflow.add_task("check_market_conditions")
workflow.add_task("execute_purchase", retry_count=3)
workflow.add_task("record_transaction")
workflow.add_task("update_portfolio")
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Reduces emotional trading decisions
- Automatic rebalancing and portfolio updates
- Multi-exchange execution for better pricing
- Built-in risk management and error handling

### Arbitrage Trading Bot
<Card title="Cross-Exchange Profit" icon="arrows-rotate">
Identify and exploit price differences across multiple exchanges or DEXs to generate consistent profits with minimal risk.
</Card>

**Real-World Scenario:**
<div style={{minHeight: '500px', height: 'auto', margin: '20px 0', width: '100%', overflow: 'auto'}}>
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Bot as Arbitrage Bot
    participant UniV3 as Uniswap V3
    participant Sushi as SushiSwap
    participant Wallet as User Wallet

    Bot->>UniV3: Check ETH/USDC price
    Bot->>Sushi: Check ETH/USDC price
    Bot->>Bot: Calculate profit potential
    alt Profitable opportunity found
        Bot->>UniV3: Buy ETH at lower price
        Bot->>Sushi: Sell ETH at higher price
        Bot->>Wallet: Transfer profit
    end
```
</div>

**Advanced Features:**
- **MEV Protection**: Frontrunning detection and mitigation
- **Gas Optimization**: Dynamic gas pricing for maximum profitability
- **Flash Loans**: Capital-efficient arbitrage without initial investment
- **Multi-hop Routing**: Complex arbitrage paths across multiple protocols

### Grid Trading System
<Card title="Range-Bound Markets" icon="grid-4">
Place buy and sell orders at predetermined intervals above and below the current market price to profit from market volatility.
</Card>

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
grid_strategy:
  symbol: "ETH/USDC"
  price_range:
    lower_bound: 1800
    upper_bound: 2200
  grid_levels: 20
  order_size: 0.1  # ETH per order
  take_profit: 1.5%
  stop_loss: 5%
  rebalancing: "daily"
```

## üè¶ DeFi Protocol Automation

### Yield Farming Optimizer
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automated Liquidity Management">

    - Impermanent loss calculation and mitigation
    - Gas cost optimization for yield movements
    - Automatic reward claiming and compounding
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Liquidity Pool Rebalancing">
    Maintain optimal asset ratios in liquidity pools by automatically adding or removing liquidity based on market conditions and IL thresholds.

    **Implementation:**
    ```python
    # LP Rebalancing Logic
    def rebalance_pool(pool_address, target_ratio, il_threshold):
        current_ratio = get_pool_ratio(pool_address)
        il_percentage = calculate_impermanent_loss(pool_address)

        if il_percentage > il_threshold:
            # Exit position to avoid further losses
            remove_liquidity(pool_address, percentage=100)
        elif abs(current_ratio - target_ratio) > 0.05:
            # Rebalance to maintain target ratio
            adjust_liquidity(pool_address, target_ratio)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lending Protocol Optimization">
    Automatically switch between lending protocols (Aave, Compound, etc.) to maximize interest earned while maintaining desired risk levels.

    **Features:**
